`Mikage
---------------
Where is it? It's gotta be here
Mikage
---------------
somewhere... I need to find that
Mikage
---------------
album quickly, before...
 `;

`Spica
---------------
So this is the place Mikage told
Spica
---------------
me about... It's a bit chilly
Spica
---------------
here, good thing I'm wearing my
Spica
---------------
winter uniform!
 `;

`Yuuhi
---------------
Now where is that album? Mikage
Yuuhi
---------------
told me she needed my help looking
Yuuhi
---------------
for it, but why?
 `;

`Urara
---------------
Zzz... (Hehe, Mikage's gonna
Urara
---------------
become bald.)

`
Tomo
---------------
So you finally came back, Mikage.
Tomo
---------------
I've been waiting for weeks since
Tomo
---------------
you took off with Yuuhi and Urara.
Tomo
---------------
Look, the ice cream's almost melted
Tomo
---------------
now because of you.
Mikage
---------------
Umm... so there's this album that can
Mikage
---------------
cure baldness, do you happen to
Mikage
---------------
know where it is?

Tomo
---------------
Oh, so I see how it is. You're
Tomo
---------------
leave me again, aren't you?
Tomo
---------------
Not this time!

`Mikage
---------------
I have to hurry now…
Mikage
---------------
I can't let Spica and
Mikage
---------------
the others see me like this.
    `;

`Spica
---------------
This place is giving me the creeps,
Spica
---------------
but I gotta do my best for her!
    `;
    
`Yuuhi
---------------
What did that ice cream girl
Yuuhi
---------------
say again?
Yuuhi
---------------
Was it left or right…
Yuuhi
---------------
Wait, where am I?
 `;

`Urara
---------------
Zzz…
Urara
---------------
(If only Spica or Yuuhi were here,
Urara
---------------
I'd still be sleeping
Urara
---------------
in bed right now…)

// PHANTOM INTROS
`Phantom
---------------
Did you come here to give up?
Mikage
---------------
I'm not here to play games with you.
Mikage
---------------
Where did you hide the album?
Phantom
---------------
Mikage, you never needed that album
Phantom
---------------
to begin with.
Phantom
---------------
It's okay to be bald.
Phantom
---------------
Spica and the others will accept you
Phantom
---------------
regardless
Phantom
---------------
Isn't that what true friends are for?
Mikage
---------------
This is completely different!
Mikage
---------------
I'll never be bald!
Mikage
---------------
Never ever ever!
    `;

`
Phantom
---------------
... begone, Spica.
Phantom
---------------
The forest of shadows does not take
Phantom
---------------
kindly to the blinding light.
Spica
---------------
Light? I don't see any here…
Spica
---------------
By the way,
Spica
---------------
did you happen to know where the
Spica
---------------
album that can cure baldness is?
Phantom
---------------
That was your last warning.
Phantom
---------------
Now you too shall experience baldness.
    `;

`Phantom
---------------
I know what you did.
Phantom
---------------
Don't think you can get away from us.
Yuuhi
---------------
Do what now?
Phantom
---------------
Don't play dumb with me,
Phantom
---------------
you murderer.
Phantom
---------------
It's about time you paid the price,
Phantom
---------------
with your hair.
    `;
    
`Phantom
---------------
Lord Urara, have mercy on us.
Urara
---------------
Zzz…
Urara
---------------
(Cease your useless begging.
Urara
---------------
I will exterminate you and your kind,
Urara
---------------
on behalf of my friend.)
